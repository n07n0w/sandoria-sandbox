## Required Environment Variables

Set these in your cloud deployment platform:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
BASE_URL=https://sandoria.org
SESSION_SECRET=your-secure-session-secret

# Database - Either use JAWSDB_URL or individual variables
JAWSDB_MARIA_URL=mysql://user:password@host:port/database
# OR
DB_HOST=your-database-host
DB_USER=your-database-user
DB_PASSWORD=your-database-password
DB_NAME=sandbox

# Peer Server
PEER_SERVER_HOST=peer-server.sandoria.org
PEER_SERVER_PORT=80
PEER_SERVER_PATH=/
PEER_SERVER_SECURE=false
```

## SSL Certificate Issue

The deployment log shows:
```
WARNING | Incorrect A-record for domain sandoria.org. Certificate will not be issued.
```

**Fix:** Update your DNS A-record to point sandoria.org to your cloud platform's IP address.

## Testing the Application

1. **Health Check**: Visit `https://sandoria.org/health` to verify the app is running
2. **Application**: Visit `https://sandoria.org/` for the main application
3. **Logs**: Check application logs for any database connection issues

## Next Steps

1. Configure your DNS A-record for sandoria.org
2. Set the required environment variables in your cloud platform
3. Redeploy the application
4. Monitor the health check endpoint

The application should now start successfully even if the database connection fails initially, allowing you to debug any remaining issues through the logs.
